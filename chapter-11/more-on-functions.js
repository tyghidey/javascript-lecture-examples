/** CALLING VS REFERENCING **/

/* Referencing a Function */

// A simple named function
function sayHello(name) {
	return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// TODO: Call the function and print the return value

// TODO: Print the function reference without calling it


/* The Function Data Type */

// TODO: Check the data type using the name reference


/* Creating an Alias */

// TODO: Create an alias for sayHello

// TODO: Call the function using the alias and print the return value

// TODO: Print the alias reference only



/** ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS **/

/* Storing an Anonymous Function as a Constant */

// TODO: Write an anonymous function and store it as a constant below. The function should take an array of numbers and use it as a key to decode a message from Will in the Upside Down, with the letters A-Z being numbered 1-26 and a space represented as 0. Return the decoded message as a string.

// Test data
let msg1 = [18, 9, 7, 8, 20, 0, 8, 5, 18, 5];
let msg2 = [18, 21, 14];

// TODO: Decode and print each message



/** HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS **/

/* Referencing an Existing Function as an Argument */

// TODO: Write a function that will convert a number into a string that has a length of exactly 3, with leading zeros if the number is less than 3 digits long. The function should simply print the string and does not need a return value.


// Test data
let indigoSubjects = [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18];

// TODO: Call the built-in array method .map() and pass in the test array with the new function (by name reference) to have it create a new array with the formatted string for each tattoo. Print the new array.


/* Providing an Anonymous Function as an Argument */

let hellfireClub = ["Eddie", "Gareth", "Jeff", "Mike", "Dustin", "Lucas", "Erica"];

// TODO: Use the built-in array method .forEach(), passing in an anonymous function that prints "_____ is a member of the Hellfire Club!" for each element in the array above... unless that person is Erica, in which case it should say "Lady Applejack, the MOST BADASS member" instead of "a member".



/** RECURSION **/

/* Testing the Efficiency of Recursion with Factorials */

// This is a linear way to solve a factorial using a for loop
function linearFactorial(n) {
	let result = 1;
	for (let i = n; i > 1; i--) {
		result *= i
	}
	return result;
}

// We can call this function and print the correct answer
console.log(linearFactorial(15));


// TODO: Write a recursive function to solve a factorial



// TODO: Call the function to test it and print the result


// TODO: Go back and use the Console API's .time() and .timeEnd() methods to clock the speed of code execution for both the linear and recursive functions


/* Working through Complex Data */

// Sometimes you have data that can't be traversed linearly, like a multi-dimensional array with an unknown number of levels. Hard-coding a bunch of nested loops won't work.

// Test data, where nested arrays represent number of demodogs within rooms/areas on separate floors of the building
let hawkinsLab = [
	[[6, 2], 3, [8, 1]],
	[[0, 5], 10],
	[7, [9, 4], 11]
];

// TODO: Write a recursive function to count up the number of demodogs chasing everyone down in the Hawkins National Laboratory (RIP Bob) 

/*
	Plan it out:

 	What is the base case (and is there only one?)
	

 	What is the divide and conquer strategy?
 	
*/

// Define the function


// TODO: Call the function with the test data
